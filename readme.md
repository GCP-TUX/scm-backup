SCM Backup is a tool which makes offline backups of your cloud hosted source code repositories, by cloning them. It supports backing up from multiple source code hosters and backing up multiple users/teams per source code hoster.    
At the moment, the following hosters are supported:

- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)

  
And it's written in [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/), which means that it's supposed to run on Windows, Linux **and** MacOS.
